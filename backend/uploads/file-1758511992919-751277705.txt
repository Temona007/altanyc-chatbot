=== FITNESS CALCULATIONS EXPLAINED ===

1. VO2 MAX ESTIMATION
The Garmin Fitness Calculator estimates your VO2 Max (maximum oxygen consumption) using heart rate data, pace, and personal information. This metric indicates your cardiovascular fitness level and can range from 30-80+ depending on age, gender, and fitness level.

2. TRAINING LOAD
Training Load measures the cumulative effect of your workouts over the past 7 days. It helps prevent overtraining and ensures optimal recovery. Values are calculated using heart rate zones, duration, and intensity.

3. BODY BATTERY
Body Battery uses heart rate variability, stress, and activity data to estimate your energy levels throughout the day. Scores range from 0-100, helping you plan optimal workout times and rest periods.

4. RECOVERY TIME
Recovery Time suggests how long to wait before your next hard workout. It's based on training load, sleep quality, stress levels, and heart rate variability data.

=== WORKOUT RECOMMENDATIONS ===

BEGINNER WORKOUTS:
- 20-30 minute walks with heart rate in Zone 2
- Bodyweight exercises with proper form
- Yoga sessions for flexibility and stress relief
- Swimming for low-impact cardio

INTERMEDIATE WORKOUTS:
